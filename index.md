# Good Day at Once! <br>

I'm a theoretical physicist working in the field of cosmology. Currently, I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Sussex, Brighton (UK) in the research group of Robert E. Smith.

I'm broadly interested in using cosmology in order to challenge current models describing the evolution of our Universe. In particular, my work focuses on studying the large-scale structure of matter and galaxies and what we can learn from their clustering properties.

<!-- Doing so can give us exciting insights into the physical processes that dominated shortly after the Universe came to be or into the nature of dark matter and dark energy.  -->
